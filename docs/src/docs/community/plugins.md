# Capacitor Community Plugins

The community has built a number of Capacitor plugins to add functionality to your app.

There are a number of ways to find community plugins: Search the web or npm to find any published plugins,
or explore the official [Capacitor Community](https://github.com/capacitor-community) GitHub org and [NPM scope](https://npmjs.com/~capacitor-community) for a curated list of quality, community supported Capacitor plugins.
